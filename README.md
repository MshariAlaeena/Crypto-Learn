This educational tool simplifies the learning of encryption and decryption by guiding
users through various methods, offering explanations, and decrypting texts. It employs frequency analysis for unrecognized 
ciphertexts, making cryptography accessible and interactive.

Let's dive into the world of cryptography and have some fun deciphering! üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíª

1- The Monoalphabetic Cipher is utilized for its foundational approach to substitution cryptography.
2- The Playfair Cipher is implemented for its ability to encrypt digraphs, offering a more complex layer of security.
3- The Vigen√®re Cipher is selected for its use of a keyword to achieve polyalphabetic substitution, enhancing cryptographic strength.
4- The Keyed Transposition Cipher is employed for its method of rearranging the plaintext to achieve encryption.
5- A combination of the Monoalphabetic Cipher and the Vigen√®re Cipher is utilized to leverage the strengths of both algorithms in a unique encryption approach.
6- The DES Cipher is incorporated for its standardized approach to symmetric‚Ä¢key encryption for electronic data.

instructions:

1. Start by choosing an action:
   ‚Ä¢ Press 1 to encrypt a message.
   ‚Ä¢ Press 2 to decrypt a message.

2. If you choose to encrypt (1), you'll see a menu with options:
   ‚Ä¢ 1 for Monoalphabetic Cipher
   ‚Ä¢ 2 for Playfair Cipher
   ‚Ä¢ 3 for Vigen√®re Cipher
   ‚Ä¢ 4 for Keyed Transposition Cipher
   ‚Ä¢ 5 for a combo of Monoalphabetic and Vigen√®re Ciphers
   ‚Ä¢ 6 for DES Cipher

3. After selecting an encryption method:
   ‚Ä¢ For Monoalphabetic Cipher, you'll first be asked how many times to shift the letters. Enter a number.
   ‚Ä¢ For all options, you'll then be asked to type in your message (plain text).

4. Upon entering your message:
   ‚Ä¢ The system encrypts your message, showing you how it's done and then displays the encrypted message.

5. Next steps:
   ‚Ä¢ 1 decrypts the message you just encrypted.
   ‚Ä¢ 2 lets you start over, choosing to encrypt or decrypt a new message.
   ‚Ä¢ 3 exits the system.

6. Note for using DES: 
   ‚Ä¢ After encrypting with DES, the system skips the mini menu and goes back to the start because DES can't decrypt in this setup.

7. If you're decrypting (2):
   ‚Ä¢ You'll enter the encrypted message.
   ‚Ä¢ The system checks if it was encrypted by it before and uses the correct method and key to decrypt it.
   ‚Ä¢ If it's a new message, the system attempts to decrypt it using frequency analysis and shows the result.

8. After decrypting, you'll return to the initial choice to encrypt or decrypt another message.
