# Encryption and Decryption Educational Tool

This Java application serves as an educational tool to demonstrate various encryption and decryption algorithms. It supports multiple cipher techniques including monoalphabetic, playfair, vigenere, keyed transposition, and more, providing an interactive way for users to encrypt and decrypt texts.

## Features

- Supports multiple encryption algorithms.
- Interactive console-based UI for easy use.
- Encrypt and decrypt text files.
- Educational tool for understanding encryption and decryption processes.

## Prerequisites

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.

## How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `EDEducationalTool.java` file.
3. Compile the Java program by running `javac EDEducationalTool.java` in your terminal.
4. Run the compiled class with `java EDEducationalTool`.
5. Follow the on-screen instructions to choose between encryption and decryption, select an algorithm, and input the text or file path as requested.

Note: Ensure all dependent classes and files (such as cipher classes) are in the same directory and compiled before running the `EDEducationalTool` class.
